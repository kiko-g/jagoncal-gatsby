I am a lecturer in the Faculty of Science of the University of Porto ([FCUP](https://fc.up.pt)), Department of Geosciences, Enviroment and Land Planning (DGAOT), and a researcher at [CIIMAR](https://www2.ciimar.up.pt) (Interdisciplinary Centre of Marine and Environmental Research), in the [Coastal Monitoring and Management Group](https://www2.ciimar.up.pt/research.php?team=4). I hold a Ph.D. in Photogrammetry (2001) and a MSc in GIS (1993) from [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/), Department of Geomatic Engineering and a degree in Surveying Engineering from FCUP.

## Teaching

I teach in the fields Photogrammetry, Topographic Mapping and Geographical Information Systems (first degree in Geospatial Engineering, Master degrees in Surveying Engineering and Remote Sensing).

## Research

My main interests are on the applications of photogrammetry and high resolution mapping to environmental monitoring. I also am interested on the integration of GNSS, inertial navigation and video for mobile mapping. For information on my publications, see my [ORCID](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9212-4649) record. Some ongoing projects:

- **[4Map4Health](https://www.chistera.eu/projects/4map4health)** - Mapping of forest health, species and forest risks using Novel ICT Data and Approaches,
- **[SWUAV](https://swuav.ciimar.up.pt/)** - Mapping the intertidal zone and assessing seaweed biomass using UAV images

## Other activities

Colaboration with the Portuguese Environmental Agency ([APA](https://www.apambiente.pt/)) in the quality control of data of the Coastal Monitoring Programme of Continental Portugal - [COSMO](https://cosmo.apambiente.pt/).
